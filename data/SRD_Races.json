Whether born of pact, purpose, or prophecy, they carry within them the legacy of those mighty wyrms. Their scaled forms, elemental breath, and fierce hearts speak to a bloodline steeped in power.\nMost dragonborn believe they are the natural children of dragons, shaped by ancient magic and chosen to walk a path of strength and honor. Their cultures are steeped in reverence for ancestry, and the names of old dragonkin are kept like relics, whispered in prayer or roared in battle. Though each clan has its own customs, nearly all share a devotion to personal excellence — whether in arms, artistry, or arcane might.\nAmong the dragonborn, there are those who seek more than pride in blood. These devoted few take on a path of Draconic Awakening, a spiritual journey to unlock the fullest potential of their ancestry. Some believe they can ascend to a higher form — becoming half-dragon, or even dragon, in soul if not in flesh. These aspirants often live in reclusion, meditating in high places or guarding ancient shrines where draconic essence still lingers. Their philosophies are diverse: some emulate metallic dragons as paragons of justice and wisdom, while others embrace the ruthless ambition of chromatics.\nYet scattered rumors persist — whispered in old tomes and half-forgotten songs — that dragonborn were once created as servitors to dragon lords, guardians of their hoards and custodians of their will. Most dragonborn dismiss such stories as slander or myth. Whether or not they were forged or born, the dragonborn have long since claimed their destiny as their own."

These words best sum up a dwarf, as they would happily tell you along with a glass of ale. They are skilled warriors, miners, craftsmen of weapons and jewelry alike, working stone and metal with a skill almost unmatched amongst the other races. Second to none in their devotion to art, dwarves reveal with as much intensity as they craft or go to war.\nShort and Stout\nThough they stand under five feet as a rule, their stout forms commonly weigh over two hundred pounds. They are not obese however, but instead their bones are thicker than normal, and their forms are designed for the squat tunnels and caves in which they build their kingdoms.\nDwarves’ skin can range from a deep brown to a pale tan, the colors of earth and stone, however a few dwarves have pale albino-like skin, these being from the depths beneath the world and not commonly found within adventuring parties.\nDwarven Gurdges\nLiving past 400 years of age, dwarves hold grudges until repaid, and it is not uncommon for a clan of dwarves to take up the grudge of a prominent member of their own. To insult one dwarf is to insult the hill, or so the proverb goes. It is because of this that they resent goblins, for it was the Hobgoblin Emporium that had destroyed their nations of hold, a fact made all the worse by the continued existence of the emporium itself.\nAs dwarves thought of their clans as a single family, they did the same for other races and would hold grudges against an entire race simply because of an offense one of their kind had done to them. However, they never bordered on xenophobia, except for goblins, which is a long mutual generation war between the two species.\nClans and Holds\nVirtually beneath any mountain chain on Atherius there exist a Hold, or a kingdom of Dwarves hidden from those they do not wish to be found by. These Holds are not unfriendly, and commonly trade with other nations near them, however they are heavily defended and trapped, invading a Hold is like besieging a mountain where every stone is a trap.\nThese Holds are collectively known as the Seven Holds, although only four existed within the Reaches, the mountain chain around the Scarred Lands east of Solmaria. Amongst dwarves the Holds were a matter of respect, for only one had fallen in all the recorded ages, although there was a rumored eighth hold, but this was heresy to say and would result in one being exiled or jailed for such a claim. Each Hold is led by a king, while smaller clans outside of holds answer to their chiefs only. A king sees a chief as an equal if from outside a Hold, with each making boast of their accomplishments while comparing the best crafts they possess.\nDwarves are bit greedy by nature, but not to the point of killing another for a possession. If one is caught having done so, their punishment is the severing of their hands, to forever keep them from possessing another item as well as taking away their ability to craft items, the skill of the utmost pride amongst Dwarves. Ownership was a strong law amongst the people, and not one any would break, or think of doing, or else losing their title as a dwarf amongst their own folk."

However, if a dwarf truly calls another nondwarf a friend, it is a compliment of the highest degree, a fact that draws respect from even other dwarves.\nThe names of the dwarves Holds, and thus the sub race, does not describe their skins outside of Bronze Dwarves which is a happenstance. Instead, it refers to the metal they are most known for trading in, and which brought their empire great riches. Likewise, they preferred to name their settlements, and even the items they crafted, after features of the earth or metal itself, and in this way they paid respect to their deities as wells the primordial elementals known to aid them."

Strangely, it was not uncommon for Iron Dwarf clans to ride large boar into battle around the lower Barrows, while those in the deeper tunnels beneath used large rhino like creatures as their mounts.\nIt should be said, although empire less, they refused to make a new one solely because the leaders of most Iron Dwarf clans remembered the tales of their fathers, great stories of their own holds and kingdoms that had fallen or been lost. They sought these out regularly, sending large expeditions to search and excavate lands where rumors of such things arose.\nThey followed their gods devoutly, drinking heavily in their name, although they were not drunkards, not for a lack of trying however, their stout constitution simply made getting intoxicated hard for the race. Referring to something as “as difficult as drinking under a dwarf” was a statement about the stupidity of attempting a task.\nTheir skin was fair or lightly tanned, while their eyes were of blue, green or yellow.

Unlike their more adventurous cousins, the Iron Dwarves, Gold Dwarves devoted themselves to bettering their Hold. Many believe, and likely rightfully, that the Gold Hold is the oldest of the Holds. This is supported by the fact the Hold shows clear signs of damage from the fall of Almaruil and the raising of the mountains in which it is found.\nThey lived in a strict society of laws, with the Dwarven King ruling, although each clan within the kingdom was allowed to send a single advisor during monthly meetings. This way their own interest could be expressed, and possibly bring attention to the needs of different parts of the Hold. All the while leaving their sovereign as the true power to the realm.\nEach clan fit into one of three castes: the merchant caste, military caste, or working caste. Although known as a caste, none truly had a higher social standing than the other, and in truth each was part of a well-oiled machine that brought the society to greatness.\nThe kingdom itself was split into smaller “cities”, although these were in truth more like districts which ran themselves unless dictated otherwise by the king. The Outer City was a ring of working caste and military caste that all travelers came to, the bulk of the rest of their civilization hidden within the heart of the mountains behind trapped walls and doors. To most, this was Golden Hold as it was known, for dwarves kept the division of their city secret.\nThe Inner City was the religious and aristocratic center of the complex, and the smallest by far. The dwarves did not see much means in having a large area dedicated to the least productive members of society, and thus they purposely kept this City to a smaller size.\nThe Under City was beneath the others, and controlled by the military caste, as well as the most heavily fortitude part of the kingdom. Day and night dwarves patrolled this city, for thousands of tunnels led into Agatha, or the Hollow Lands in the common tongue. Agatha was the immense tunnels, caves and chambers that spread beneath the ground, full of strange aberrations and vile creatures they kept at bay.\nA gold dwarf was as gruff as normal, but a bit more friendly towards outsiders than others of their race, for travelers and merchants were common in the outer city. They had no distaste for elves, but preferred the company of gnomes most, and it was said the smaller folk helped reinforce the city in numerous places. However, the most astounding trait of a Gold Dwarf, was their pride, a fact that some misinterpreted as the meaning of their name, not for the fact they ran the wealthiest gold trade center of the world.\nTheir skin was light brown to golden brown, with hazel or brown eyes. Their hair ranged as much as a human’s however, and their beards were allowed to grow long but normally kept well-groomed and tied back around their heads or around their waste like a belt."

For this they have commonly been hired by others as black smiths, and a stereotype for this line of work has become ingrained in the common folk.\nBronze Dwarves loved drinking, even for a dwarf, and loved to startle outsiders by letting the liquid burst into flame upon touching their lips. They drink liquors of higher proof than mead, carrying not for the waterier drinks over their distilled whiskeys and bourbons.\nThey were the most jovial dwarf, loving to joke or play pranks on their kin, but were careful to never do so to an outsider.

They shaped the world, and it shaped them, the original elves quickly adapting into several subspecies of their king that formed the first elven nations.\nThe nations were united by the Elven Court, a city of stone and trees at the heart of an ancient forest, each elven species had a presence, a say in the matters of their race. A seat on the court was called a Crown and having a crown as a symbol of being a recognized elven species. In this way the elves wished to avoid the turmoil of the Seelie and Unseelie courts. As the elves spread across the world and adapted, the Court would decide if they constituted a new Crown or not based on their populace and uniqueness. Laws passed by this Court were one of the last works of High Magic and thus must be followed by all members of the Court.\nFey Embodiments\nElves can range greatly dependent on the sub race, some are tall while others are shorter than the common man, however all are lithe, possessing sight and hearing far superior to our own, and possessing an air of elegance that makes them almost alien to behold, a trait most fey possess. Humans and other intelligent races call them fey-folk, or faerie folk, at times, although this is misleading and considered inappropriate by scholars, for they are not true fey.\nElves live in the world of Atherius, but are not truly part of it, and each feels the pull of Faerie throughout their lives. Most retreat to a portal back to their ancestral homes near the end of their lives, their forms simply giving out and releasing the energy within to return to it if they do not. Therefore, elves shun undead as a most disgraceful form, for with it they cannot return to their ancestral lands and are forever barred from passing into the light of Aelfheim.\nAlthough age varies depending on the sub race, all elves can live past 500 years, however, unlike the fey from which they descend, elves can die of wounds, poison, disease and in a way, old age. More accurately an elf will reach an age where the weight of their lives is too much for them to wish to continue, passing into the light normally before their thousandth year. The oldest elves, great mages of unparalleled power, may live on forever if they do not lose the will to do so.\nElves do not sleep like most races, their minds not touching the Demiplane of Dreams, instead they enter a trance, where they experience their own memories in clarity. This is one reason elves make good mages, for even in their time of rest, they can study and learn at a rate few could match.\nMuch of this came crashing down during the Age of Wyrmfire, then the ensuing Kin Wars were brother turned on brother.\nAncient Bloodline Feud\nDuring the ages past, their civilization was destroyed time and time again by a series of Kin Wars, racial wars between the different Crowns. Most lost their empires, much of their cultures and magical ways, now living in small villages hidden away from others. A few kingdoms stand once more, with the Greywood being one such place in the Northern Reaches. Umbar’Serin is another, and the last true kingdom of the High Elves, erected before the Kin Wars tore the elves apart. These wars are not well documented, and even amongst the elven races there is much debated about their true origins, motives, and events, however it is known several elven races ceased to exists after these wars, while others were forever changed by magics now barred by the Courts.\nReligion\nElves followed no gods, however they venerated Archfey, powerful fey from Faerie whose powers easily matched a deity while within their home plane. Each sub race of elf also has a pantheon, although these are not true gods, but those of their race that have been accepted into the Courts, become one of the Archfey themselves."

They are known as the Elir'Elvar, or People of the Light. They are also known as High Elves, for they were the first to travel to the material world and build a prospering kingdom upon it.\nAlthough closer to nature than man, the High Elves are not as intone with nature as their Wood Elven cousins and instead are far more closely intoned with magic itself. Living in great cities of metal and stone, each of which commonly houses a single Elf Stone, highly dweomered artifact which projected a magical veil across the city.\nHigh Elves obsess over the lore and magic of their people, and to a slightly less degree, other elves. They will collect scrolls, tomes, and all magical items in the past ages related to their kin for study and safe keeping, and their military is almost always planning some sort of crusade or reclamation of ancient cities of their fallen kingdoms.\nTheir skin tends to be a darker tan, almost coppery, with hairlike strands of sun. Meanwhile their eyes are green or hazel, seldom are they any other color, and having eyes not of these colors is seen as a sign that a House's blood had become muddled by another race. They are not xenophobic by nature, although dangerously close to the ideology for mistakes amongst the common folk are frequent.\nProud of their heritage, High Elves never name their cities out of the Elven Tongue, and each bears an importance to the purpose of the city itself. Umbar'Serin, or Our Fate, is the Elven Court first founded on Nibiru. Their attire is normally sleek golden armor accented with green fabrics, fashioned in thin plates that almost resemble leaves or ferns, while blades are their preferred weapons. Within their cities it is common to find crypts, great cities for fallen heroes whose bodies are laid to rest.\nThey still retain a bit of the light of Aelfheim, a demiplane of Faerie ruled by their Eladrin ancestors, or grace as it is also known, shinning from within them as a sort of aura. Normally just barely visible, those of advanced age or power displayed it more clearly."

Banished or exiled by ancient decrees or led by prophetic visions into the bowels of the world, they carved their homes in the deep, black stone of Agartha—a subterranean realm of chasms, rivers of molten silver, and predator-filled jungles of luminous fungus.\nIn this vast underworld, the Drow embraced a new pantheon—gods of venom and cunning, most notably spider and scorpion deities that whisper through toxin and trance. Their society is tribal, matriarchal, and steeped in rites of blood, poison, and silence. What some call cruelty, they call survival. What others call savagery, they consider faith.\nIn their subterranean cities one will find scorpions and spiders alongside elves, as well as races like their revered pets. They showcase their devotion in their magic as well, utilizing venomous spells above other elemental options. However, men and women are treated as different caste in the cities, both important.\nMale drow are seen as the children of Zherak, the Poisoned. He is the consort of Velratha, being a unique type of drider but with the lower body of a scorpion with two massive claws. Males pray to him as they are trained in combat in the pits, whispering his name into the sand before every fight. His favor is won through discipline, deception, and precision—not brute force. It is their reverence of Zherak that has caused Drow males to favor the scorpion tail whip as an off hand weapon."

Those of high rank in their faith can receive the Matron’s Bite, a rite that transforms them into a Drider, an elevated form of Drown that has the lower body of a spider.\nDrow families form small clans, with the main branch being blood relatives and the lesser branch being conscripted soldiers, and non-blood allies that have sworn fealty to the family. A single city can have dozens of large families, and multitudes of minor ones not yet risen to prominence. Trickery and deceit are seen as tools of advancement in the Drow society, with family wars not being uncommon, the defeated house being absorbed entirely by the winner, and lost to the city.\nDrow have striking features: onyx, violet, or deep blue skin, with silver, white, or pale lavender hair. Their eyes glow faintly in dim light, reflecting the hues of the underworld—red, gold, or amber. Unlike their surface cousins, Drow rarely wear armor of metal, preferring silk-woven leather, alchemical chitin, or living fungus armor, all laced with toxins or glyphs of their deities. They are master smiths, utilizing mithril above all other metals, especially in their weapons."

Although preferring to keep to themselves, in each of their major cities one may find Elf Gates, a pavilion of magical gates leading to various other elven cities.\nAbove all else they revere nature, and live in harmony with it, being descendants of the Spring Court of Seelie. They use magic related to nature to literally sing their cities from the trees, normally high off the ground to keep out of the eyes of invaders. Within their forest one must tread lightly, for it is said for each twig broken, a bone will break in kind.\nNot overly hostile, their kind prefers to divert invaders away from their forest, unless it is orcs, whom they have not forgiven for the burning of Duskwood, nor the massacre at the Grove of Elindel during the Age of Fire. Within their forest one will find a sacred grove where each family of Wood Elf has a tree, under the roots of which their dead are lain, to return to nature, nourishing the tree itself which houses a Dryad bound to the family, who also takes on the memories of those that nourish its tree. Treants are common defenders of these groves, making it most unwise to trespass in one. Unlike most elves, they do not seek to return to Aelfheim, and instead on death, their Grace infuses the forest itself.\nWood Elves revere several holy days, with each new moon and full moon being marked by a forest wide dance beneath the stars. The spring solstice is their holiest day however and is celebrated by each member of a forest going out and using all that they can to foster the growth and strengthening of their forest kingdoms.\nTheir skin is like that of bark, dark brown but with a tinge of green, while their hair is black or auburn with eyes of green or hazel. Their clothes are green and brown, fashioned to blind in with the forest, with arrows being their primary means of defending themselves."

This grants them a natural affinity for spells of illusion and darkness, mainly innately having the power to call upon certain abilities related to them. Although some label them evil, Dark Elves vary in alignment like all other elves, for the Fey Courts are not divided along such lines, and even the Winter Court knows good and just members. Their elven name is the Dolvo’Elvar, or People of the Gloom.\nAlthough a member of the Court, it was a random attack on them by the High Elves that caused the first Kin War. This attack was fueled by a lie form an interloper god from beyond the world. This betrayal has created a deep divide amongst the two races, one that is not easily overcome even to this day.\nThey reside mainly in the Frozen Waste to the north as it reminds them of their ancestral homes in the realm of Faerie, and although few truly remember it, it's feeling still resides in them all. This connection makes them inclined to live in frost filled caves or ruins now covered in snow, for they do not make their own grand cities.\nLiving in the savage tundras of the world, these elves are bleaker in outlook, and less attuned to the living nature of the world. They like to play pranks on other races by causing small snowstorms or throwing random snowballs from out of site, however as they mainly come out at night, the havoc is kept to a minimum. In some respects, they are more fey like then others of their ilk.\nThe different groups of dark elves mainly live in isolation, only coming together during the Winter Solstice each year, to discuss matters of their people and those of their fey lords in Faerie.

The plane on which they live has stripped them of their more redeeming qualities, and they have no humor, outside of that which we would call dark, to speak of. Nor do they express emotions normally, this part of their soul growing weaker each generation on the Shadow Plane, a strange detachment that even other Fey find to be alien and unnerving to behold.\nWithin their society the only thing that matters is one’s devotion to their Queen and ways to increase their own power. Each city of Shadow Elves follows a single Shadowlord, a being whose connection to the shadows is strongest amongst them, the cities themselves functioning like a single large House of other elves. The Queen allows them their free will to further their dedication to her, allows searching for new ways to strengthen their body to the darkness of their realm.\nShadow elves dedicate their lives to mastering their own bodies, seeing little use in art of any type or leisurely activities. Legions of their warriors train endlessly within the plane, as their wizards and clerics seek ways to expand their respective cities influence in to please the Queen. A spiked chain is a common weapon of the people, as are polearms and nets. All Shadow Elves are taught to use their racial abilities to their advantage and will not hesitate to “cheat” a foe in a fight.\nAmongst the Elvar they dislike High Elves the most, for their obvious connection to the Light of Aelfheim, the ancient city from which elves are said to originate, while Dark Elves they view as distant cousins although lesser than themselves. Forest elves are seen as lower class and ignorant. However, the only Elvar they truly hate and see as mortal enemies is one of their own Court, the Ghost Elves. The two races have warred since the second Kin War, each blaming the other for their banishments.\nAdventuring Shadow Elves may be searching for items related to darkness or shadows, relics of the Plane of Shadows or even creatures of it that they wish to study. Some search for new ways to bind themselves to powers related to such matters, with several demon lords eyeing the race with interest and fear as their own domains revolve around such matters; and the Shadow Queen is a sly one indeed."

The reason for this banishment varies depending on who you ask, the Light Elves or the Ghost Elves.\nThey have no real religion, worshipping the Pale Lady as their own god, a similarity shared with the Shadow Elves whom they see as mortal enemies. Whom or what the Pale Lady really is, no one knows, but she appears as a pale elven matriarch clad in multiple layers of shifting white veils that obscuring her form. Some speculate she may be the being that originally pulled the elves into the Ethereal Plane, but those that openly speak of such things vanish overnight.\nTheir civilization lives within a single city, for the ethereal plane had no real material to it, and they simply reshaped the forest or mist to expand the city when needed. They are militaristic, their army constantly searching for new denizens to subjugate and cities to claim and incorporate into their own. Within the shifting haze of the Ethereal Plane, their city seems to vanish and reappear at their Queen’s whims. It is common to find Ghost Elf warriors riding atop Phase Spiders, the two creatures working harmoniously in their hunts.\nThey wear thin veils that lightly obscure their bodies, taking great pride in physical beauty, while those clad for ware don mithril or similar mail, never donning heavy armor. However, in the material world they are known to wear thick layers of veils or scarves, to hide their natural aura.\nThey have little interest in the material world; besides the magical items and secrets it may hold. As a race they have no desire to resettle in their old kingdoms and truly do not consider themselves the same race as that they had once been. However, it is known they do envy birds and other musical creatures of the material world, as their own bleak realm lacks such things, and are known to buy or trade zealously for them.\nTheir forms are smaller than most elves with seemingly thin limbs, skin as white as the moon, hair of fog and eyes devoid of all colors. A strange soft glow always emitted from their bodies, a trait they could not control. They were beautiful nonetheless; a trait they knew they could use to their advantage."

Known for their small stature, big hearts, and well-stocked pantries, Halflings rarely make a stir in the world at large—though most of them would be just fine keeping it that way.\nThough technically part of the Reaches, Halflings in the south maintain a loose affiliation with its politics and wars. Their villages are tight-knit and stubbornly independent, ruled more by respected elders and seasonal festivals than any noble decree. The Reaches may rise and fall, but the spring planting always comes.\nField Folk and Hearthwise\nHalflings are primarily farmers, brewers, and herders, having lived off the land for countless generations. Their terraced farms and orchard-lined roads are a patchwork of beauty against the southern horizon. Despite their simplicity, their agriculture is second to none—many human markets depend on Halfling grains, fruits, and smoked meats to get through the winter."

Villages revolve around seasonal festivals, shared meals, and long evenings filled with stories, song, and more than a few mugs of something homemade.\nTrouble Has Long Legs\nHalflings may be peaceful, but they are not naive. Living so near to the Barrowlands, they’ve learned to keep a wary eye on the north, where fell things sometimes stir in the ruins and moors. Old tales speak of dark winters where the fields turned quiet and the lanterns burned low. These days, most towns maintain hidden cellars, signal stones, and watchfolk just in case something wanders too far south.\nSome Halflings are rumored to be touched by old spirits of the land itself—hearth ghosts and field wights that guard the hills in unseen ways. Whether this is superstition or something stranger is left unsaid... but when a child speaks of lights in the corn or a stranger disappearing into the mist, the elders simply nod, and the village doors are bolted tighter.\nWanderers and Wild Seeds\nWhile most Halflings are content to stay near their gardens and granaries, some few are born with the “wild seed”—a restless heart that yearns to see the world. These are the rare Halflings who become adventurers, scouts, or emissaries to the larger cities. While few in number, they carry the resilience of deep roots and the cunning of quiet folk, often mistaken for being far less dangerous than they are.\nWhen one of these folk returns home—if they return at all—they are greeted with a feast, a dozen questions, and a quiet understanding that they are a little changed... and perhaps a little haunted."

These giant kings and queens may be long gone, but the Goliaths who remain are the descendants of those once-unmatched beings. Though they now walk among other races, their blood still carries the weight of their giant ancestors, granting them unnatural resilience and raw strength that can shake the earth itself.\nAs Goliaths grow, they often face harsh environments in remote mountain peaks or isolated valleys, places where only the strongest survive. These challenging landscapes have honed their endurance and competitive nature. To Goliaths, strength is not just physical but a mark of character, and many of their societies revolve around fierce competitions and rites of passage. For these towering humanoids, pushing the limits of their abilities is not only a matter of pride, but also a necessary means of survival in the unforgiving environments they call home.\nMany tribes of Goliath are strictly tribalistic, only associating with those of the same blood, even amongst other giant kind. Many tribes see the giants from which they descend as a type of deity, worshipping the game gods as their ancestors.\nThough their giant heritage courses through their veins, Goliaths are a people driven by the desire to prove themselves and carve out their place in the world. They may be seen as intimidating or aloof by other races, but those who earn the Goliath's respect find them to be unwavering allies. Goliaths often choose lives of adventure, seeking to test their strength in new challenges and prove their worth to themselves and others. Some claim their origins were linked to the ancient kingdoms of the giants, but whatever the truth may be, their enduring legacy continues to shape them as they walk the world, large in stature and even larger in heart."

Although they can be found within almost any cave and mountain, the only real orc society exist in what is now the Scarred Lands, thriving as warring tribes beneath powerful warlords, living a rugged live that may seem to be almost primal to others. The Scarred Land Orcs are the orcs one would find adventuring around, while the bands of marauding orcs are normally outlaws or criminals of their own societies having fled death.\nOriginally pulled from another world into that of Atherius by Luzgan the Fire Lord, a fey lord that had once claimed the ancient kingdom of Gorulmuk as his own, refashioning it into the magocracy that was Almaruil. They were fashioned into his warmachine that would roll across the western lands, destroying many civilizations that would not rise again.\nScarred and Strong\nOrcs have a grayish to green pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth with protruding canines, all features that give them a distinct porcine look. They have towering builds, standing over six feet normally, and easily weighing between 220 and 280 pounds, their bodies naturally burn calories at an accelerated rate and their muscles grow quicker as well, giving most of their race a slightly hulking look.\nThe blasted Scarred Lands are horrendously difficult to survive on, tribes competing with another savage beast on an almost daily occurrence. Thanks to this way of life Orcs regard battles scars as tokens of pride, often displaying them openly, almost ornamentally, and they are seen as a sign of beauty. Likewise, all men are expected to be warriors of some sort, those who are not shamans, and woman as well were expected to be able to fight.\nOutside of birthing children, their existed no true divide between men and women of the Orcish tribes. They all hunted, tanned hides, and fought in battles against other tribes. The way the men would leave their children and women behind has led some to believe they are heartless or cruel, but in truth they simply trust their women to be more than enough to handle any threat that might come to their children and elderly.\nWarriors of advanced age would set out on a last “crusade”, a personal quest to meet a foe on the road that will strike them down. However, they fought tooth and nail against any threat, as dying freely would be an insult to their gods. They preferred to die in one-on-one combat with another champion or warrior of renown.\nThey often tied bones into their hair, and piercings were not uncommon amongst them. Some tribes went as far as to graft metal ridges or plates into their skin.\nTribal Folk\nOrcs live within tribes, with each tribe having a ceremonial name given to them thanks to some feature or accomplishment of its foundering patron. Each of these tribes are led by a Dailuk, or a war chief, whom makes the laws and rules of the tribe. However, one warlord stands above the others, and is given the title of Dailuk-hai (Grand Warlord in their tongue) who can call the tribes together for council, court, or to initiate a great Herne-hai (Great Hunt) which say the tribes banding together to sweep across neighboring lands for resources.\nAlthough laws varied from tribe to tribe, the Dailuk-hai of old had laid down several which all tribes must adhere to. One tribe stealing from another was not tolerated, and the offending tribe’s warriors would be killed to the last, while the woman and children would be given to the tribe with the closest living relatives, if none claimed them, tribes could buy them to add to their own numbers (this was not slavery, they were treated as true members of the tribe).\nNormally tribes compete in competitions, hunts of some great beast, or single combat between champions to settle disputes. However, a tribe could war against another if they thought they could defeat the weaker tribe, for if one could be defeated then they were seen as a weakness within the Orcish Horde. Only the Dailuk-hai could interfere in these wars, other tribes were not permitted to intervene at all, not even to lend resources.\nThey saw no need for niceties, as their world did not permit such things. Their speaking was blunt, almost offensive to those who did not understand their culture and had a way of being almost ironic at times. None orcs could be taken in by a tribe if they displayed qualities that impressed them, these “nul-oruk” were second class citizens however, as they could not be true “oruk” and thus could not lead their people’s tribes nor religions.\nTribes were named in ways that described their unique features or accomplishments; skull crushers, white scales, flame eyed, while personal names were harder words, full of consonant sounds that did not flow easily off the tongue.\nDetachment from Innovation\nThey did not ride horses, for the animals were unfit for their world or jagged stone, and instead rode strange rhinoceros-like creatures with thick bone plates on their heads. They see machinery as a tool but prefer to use the animals or their world instead, although animals to them did include trolls and other dimly intelligent humanoids.\nThey had a mutual understanding with the Worg packs of their lands, not friendly nor hostile with them. However, in times of need, they would cooperate, hunting together or banding together to overcome a threat to the Scarred Lands.\nAlthough not an industries people, a few tries retained the crafting knowledge of their fallen empire, creating thick armors of black plate and wicked swords. Although this armor was only ever worn in war, normally the orcs simply wore hides and leathers. A few clans have indeed begun to repopulate the ruins of fallen Almaruil.\nReligion"

This belief does cause some to worship demons and devils as well, and in truth their kind does not look down upon these tribes unless they turn their back on the Orcish gods as well.\nTheir spirituality was driven by shamans, often druids devoid to fire, and their holiest of days was a lunar eclipse. It was seen as the fiery eye of their god peering down at the world, and on this day the Dailuk-hai would organize the clans and ride out to pillage neighboring lands, neither set tingling or claiming them as their own, but taking all resources they came across.\nA full moon in winter was a sign of their Goddess of fertility, beckoning them to propagate and continue their race. A vast majority of orcs would follow their sign, and most if not all women of age would bear children in the early summer."

You gain a +2 racial bonus on checks with those two skills.\nForgeborn\nA strange race, and one of limited number, hailing from a single city within the heart of the Shattered Peaks, the eastern mountain range of the Scarred Lands. The Forgehold is the only city claimed by them, and its history is muddled at best, once being a dwarven Hold that fell in ages past. How it fell is rumor, only whispered about in impolite conversations far out of earshot of all dwarves, as is the true nature of the Forgeborn and their connection to the dwarves themselves.\nThey are sentient constructs, born from the Soul Forge at the heart of the great city. Unlike other races they cannot procreate, age nor sleep, being truly as timeless as the material their bodies are crafted from. They cannot bleed either, instead if wounded they seem to release small sparks of fire, larger wounds releasing more dangerous gouts.\nBorn from the Forge\nAll Forgeborn was created for war it seems, fashioned as some ancient army that now lives with their city without a purpose. Their army is known as The Legion, moving together in synchronicity no living organism could match, many of them wielding spears and shields. However, rare Forgeborn have been seen with modifications to their bodies; hidden compartments, limbs with retractable weapons, and some even bear the eldritch runes of giants.\nAlthough seemingly crafted only for war, in recent years other Forgeborn have started emerging form the Forgehold, travelers and merchants. These, unlike their Legion kin, leave the boundaries of their kingdom and travel freely amongst the other lands.\nBuilt, not Born\nForgeborn was beings of metal and stone, having no wood in their composition, standing over 6‘ and weighing over 300 lbs. on average. They have only two large toes on the front of each foot, with a third protruding off the heel, giving them a remarkable stable footing.\nThe art of creating Forgeborn is known only to the Golden King, having been lost with the fall of the Hold he now occupies. The Golden King crafts their bodies along with his artificers and imbues a tiny amount of the Eternal Fire within the body, giving them life as it spreads throughout their forms. How he wields the Fire, and what the flames true nature is, is still unknown to outside scholars.\nAs of now, no Forgeborn seems to age, their bodies seemingly truly eternal in that regard. They can die however, if too much of the flame leaks from their form, they will become inert, and if not stopped they perish like all races. A forgeborn may graft pieces of fallen allies to their own body, commonly doing so with the rune that each possesses on their breast, bearing their names.\nThey do not have parents, referring to the Golden King and Soul Forge as their creators instead. Likewise, they do not understand a soul nor its concept. When a Forgeborn dies, the flame within it is sought out by others of their kind to return to the Soul Forge, to be crafted once more into physical form, a process known as “Reforged” amongst their kind. If one’s flame is not returned to the Forge, it is unknown what truly occurs to it.\nEach Forgeborn also bears a single rune on their chest, which is their true name, but they take their common names (the one others refers to them as) from items of importance to them. A bard might take the name of an instrument, while a wizard of some arcane relic. Their true names are only used in the most formal circumstances, or times of importance. A Forgeborn removing their rune is a sign of them turning away from their lord, and the Eternal Flame, forever becoming an outsider to their people.\nSeeking a Purpose\nAlthough within the Forgehold Forgeborn are like servants and soldiers to the Golden King, many whom leave the boundaries of the city find themselves suddenly wondering about the world around them, its meaning and how they fit into it. These is the cause of most adventurers of this race, although some still under their lords influence simply seek out new armors and weapons to bring back to their Legion, as well as new Rune magic and Artificer secrets they can assimilate. All Forgeborn are fascinated by Golems, finding them like kin, although they pity them for not having real life like their own."

Additionally, if you take damage, small sparks of fire can be seen leaking from your body as you burn through your internal Eternal Flame.\nReforged (Ex): When you die, if your Eternal Flame is not extinguished entirely, it can be retrieved and brought back to the Soul Forge to be reincarnated as a new Forgeborn. As part of this process, you are fully restored to life after being returned to the Forge, with no memory of your past experiences.\nArmored Bodies (Ex). You do not wear armor like other species, instead incorporating it into your mechanical body. Unlike most races, it takes you 1 hour to don a set of armor, as you add it to your mechanical body. Armor provides you with all the benefits of wearing it, and armor donned cannot be forcibly removed from you.\nYou may don magical armor, gaining all the benefits as normal this way. Likewise, spells and effects that would affect armor affect your armored bodies as normal.\nTool Proficiency: You gain proficiency with one set of artisan's tools of your choice (tinker’s tools, smith’s tools, or mason’s tools).\nSharak’ka\nTo many surface-dwellers, the oceans are unknowable depths, best avoided or exploited. But beneath those crushing waves and starlit shallows dwell the Sharak'ka—a people of jaws and honor, born from blood, tide, and song. Shark-bodied and steel-souled, the Sharak'ka are a people shaped by the weight of the sea and the hunger of legacy.\nThe Blood-Bound Deep\nThe Sharak'ka claim their ancestry from the first predator—A’rrgalor, the Hunger-Who-Waits, a divine beast who gnawed the roots of the world and was slain only when the ocean itself turned against him. From A’rrgalor’s teeth came the Sharak'ka, not to inherit his gluttony, but to restrain it. In their culture, hunger is sacred—not just the physical need, but all desire. To want is to live. To master that want is to become more than a beast.\nThey call themselves “The Blood-Bound” not because they love violence, but because blood is their most ancient vow—spilled in battle, sealed in kinship, shed to mark triumph. Even the sea itself responds to blood, they say, and to speak falsehood beneath the waves is to choke on salt.\nToday, many Sharak'ka dwell in Lemuria, a mist-wreathed kingdom of black coral towers and sunken avenues. A city-state hidden in the Kraken’s gale, Lemuria is ruled by a holy cult devoted to A’rrgalor. They do not shun his hunger—they revere it. In blood rituals and trance-frenzies, they seek communion with the Hunger-Who-Waits, embracing the predator within as a sacred truth. The cult claims it alone can awaken the great god dreaming beneath the abyss.\nStrength and the Tides\nTo the Sharak'ka, strength is more than physical might. It is endurance. It is clarity. It is the ability to sense the currents beneath what is spoken. In combat, they are ferocious, often wielding bone-crafted weaponry and fighting with precision and fury in equal measures. On land, their presence is felt before it is seen: broad, still, and slow-moving—until suddenly, explosively fast.\nIn their great reef-citadels or aboard nomadic tide-cruisers, Sharak'ka society is ruled by Clutch-Mothers and Blood-Speakers—elders who speak truths that have cut their way down generations. They believe in testing their young early, casting them into survival trials known as the Bloodrising, where they must earn their mark and bind their purpose.\nTruth in Teeth\nAmong the Sharak'ka, lies are worse than cowardice. A falsehood is like spoiled meat—it poisons all it touches. They speak directly, even brutally, and consider euphemism a sign of weakness. However, they are not without subtlety; the Sharak'ka honor wordplay and clever phrasing, so long as the heart of a truth remains clear.\nThey are not cruel by default, although as Lemuria is the source of many traveling the Northern Reaches, outsiders may see them as such. They simply do not soften the world. Death, loss, love, hunger—these are real, ever-present forces. They do not hide from them. They face them head-on and expect others to do the same.\nTo see a Sharak'ka warrior stalking the battlefield is to witness the ocean’s wrath in flesh. But to speak with one is to glimpse a mind as deep and ancient as the abyss itself."

Sometime in your families past, a human member made a pact with a devil and breed with them, creating a half-demon offspring from which your lineage arose. In most places of the world you are viewed with suspicion, for you are feared to be in the thrall of your devil ancestors power, a threat that can really occur in some cases.\nHowever, you are tolerated in most areas, although the country of Solmaria does not allow your kind within its border, although the Veil will not keep you from entering. Elves view you as an oddity, but do not pass judgement unnecessarily, while Dwarves and Gnomes distrust you as they do any outsider. Orcs see you as above a normal human, seeing your family respectfully for seeking a means to acquiring power.\nOnly a single land could be called a Tiefling country, although they are also common in Valerune, and that would be Rhun. Desolate and harsh, it is a desert land much like the infernal landscape itself. Tieflings of Rhun often tattoo themselves in Infernal glyphs to show their lineage, but some wear glamours to hide it. However, Bloodstones—small red stones implanted in the forehead—are a cultural practice in Rhun and help focus infernal power.\nInfernal Features\nAlthough largely human to behold, your kind has a distinct infernal heritage that manifest in a number of ways. All Tieflings have one of the following features, although many possess several; horns, skin of a devilish hue depending on your ancient ancestor, tails, cloven feet, the smell of brimstone, teeth like a canine, and even strange eyes of solid color. Their hair is oddly smooth, never curling, and ranges between red, blue, purple, or black.\nInfernal Features\nNormally living in small communities within the outskirts of other human cities or towns, there does exist a small land of Tieflings to the east, just below the Sea of Clouds in a strange area of the world known as the Free Lands. The city of Rhun is ruled by a Tiefling, but has earned itself a notorious reputation thanks to the allowance of an open thieves guild within its borders, as well as the Onyx Tower, a mage tower dedicated to magic concerning infernal and abyssal study.\nBloodline Feud\nUnsurprisingly Tieflings and those of celestial blood or allegiance have a natural distrust for each other, their lineages naturally finding the other to be distrustful or feared. Although this has not resulted into much bloodshed over the years, with Solmaria growing in power the Tieflings of Mu have grown fearful of a crusade against their kind."

Their orc heritage grants them a fierce will to survive and a hardened body tempered by battle, while their human side often brings a desire for something more—more peace, more purpose, or more legacy. Whether they grow up among the tribal orcs of the Scarred Lands or within human settlements across the Reaches or the Free Cities, half-orcs walk a difficult path shaped by strength, stigma, and soul-searching.\nIn orc society, half-orcs are not shunned, but neither are they fully embraced. The warlike orcs respect strength above all else, and a half-orc who can hold their own is given space and even praise, but their blood is always a reminder of a union forged not of love, but of conquest, diplomacy, or necessity. Among humans, half-orcs often face prejudice, whispered fears, or misguided assumptions of violence. Many become mercenaries, bodyguards, or bounty hunters—not because they must, but because it is a role society is comfortable assigning them."

This straddling of cultures can leave many half-elves feeling isolated, yet it also gifts them with a rare adaptability and independence. They learn early to navigate shifting expectations and to forge their own identity from the fragments offered by both sides.\nSome half-elves thrive as diplomats, spies, or artists, slipping between courts and cultures with the ease of those born to duality. Others take to the road, living as adventurers, traders, or scholars, drawn by wanderlust and the promise of something more than the roles they’ve been handed. In the Free Cities and in the arcane academies of Far Venthir, half-elves are sometimes praised for their talent and versatility—though behind that praise is often an undercurrent of suspicion, admiration, or both.
