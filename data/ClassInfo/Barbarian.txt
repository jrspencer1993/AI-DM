Barbarian

Storm with rage and wade into hand-to-hand combat.
Barbarians are found across the most untamed frontiers—where civilization falters and nature reigns. They are common among the nomadic tribes of the Frozen Waste to the north, the fierce clans of the southern continent’s wild jungles, and the scattered survivors in the rugged lands reclaimed by nature after the fall of Almaruil. 
Though often dismissed by more "civilized" cultures as primitive or unrefined, barbarians possess a raw strength and clarity of purpose that few can match. Their ferocity in battle, unyielding loyalty, and unshakable resolve have earned them the respect of those who fight beside them—and the fear of those who stand against them. During battle, there exist few as reliable as the barbarian to stem to tide of foes. 
One aspect of the civilized lands barbarians finds the most perplexing is religion. Dedicated buildings for mass worship with hundreds paying lip service and coin to the benefactors of the state are bewildering to them. For in their society, one does not simply claim to serve a god, but actively purpose acts of grandeur in their honor.
