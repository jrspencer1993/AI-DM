Sorcerer

Innate magic pulses through the blood of the Sorcerer, an untamed and raw force that bends reality itself. Unlike scholars who learn the art of magic through years of study, the Sorcerer is born with a deep connection to the arcane. This connection may come from mysterious ancestors, a hidden power awakened within them, or the very essence of the world itself. Whatever the source, a Sorcerer's magic flows naturally and without restraint, erupting in powerful bursts that seem to draw from the very fabric of existence. They are the embodiment of unrefined, instinctual magic, wielding it not through careful control, but through will and emotion. Most Sorcerers are often found in places where magic runs wild or where there are no restrictions on magical exploration. Remote corners of the world, far from the bureaucratic gaze of academies and temples, are often where they first tap into their powers. In these outlying areas, where magic is often seen as a force to be harnessed without the oversight of tradition, a Sorcerer's abilities may emerge unexpectedly and uncontrollably. This can lead to a sense of isolation, as they are viewed with both fear and awe by those who do not understand them. Despite the challenges, Sorcerers are driven by an unyielding desire to master their innate abilities; their magic is spontaneous and sometimes erratic, but no less potent than any other spellcaster’s. The wild magic within them can change the course of history, for good or ill, and their path is filled with both exhilaration and danger—because for a Sorcerer, power is never truly contained.

CLASS FEATURES
============================================================

LEVEL 1: Spellcasting (Ex), Sorcerous Bloodline (Ex), Bloodline Spell List (Ex), Minor Bloodline (Su)

FEATURE: Spellcasting (Ex)
Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells.

Spell Slots: The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+: You prepare the list of level 1+ Sorcerer spells available to you. To start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Sorcerer spells until your list matches the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Changing Your Prepared Spells: Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability: Charisma

Spellcasting Focus: You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.

Creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Charisma modifier + your Sorcerer level), taking 4d6 damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. You can use this ability once per day. You may spend 1 Sorcery Point to use the ability even if already used.

Fey Bloodline:
- Fey Step & Briars (Su): As a Bonus Action, you can cast Misty Step.

Creatures of your choice that start their turn in the aura or enter it for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC = 8 + your Charisma modifier + your Sorcerer level) or become Frightened until the end of their next turn. A creature that succeeds is immune to your aura for 24 hours.

Fey Bloodline:
- Tongue Twister (Su): You can spend 2 Sorcery Points to cast Counterspell as a reaction without expending a spell slot.

Until the curse ends, the target can’t cast spells with a Verbal component, and when it speaks, it says the opposite of what it means.
- Witch Strike (Su): Spend 1 Sorcery Point to cast Witch Bolt without expending a spell slot on each creature within 60 feet of you that is cursed by you.

- Infernal Saturation (Su): Whenever you cast a spell that deals fire or necrotic damage, add your Charisma modifier (minimum +1) to one damage roll of the spell.

- Stat Block: Use the creature’s stat block, but substitute your Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom for the creature’s Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom.
- Spells: You may still cast spells in the new form. Your spellcasting ability remains Charisma. You can cast spells that don’t require material components or somatic gestures (and metamagic that modifies components still applies).
