Warlock

There are those who study the arcane, those born to it, and those who steal it. Warlocks are none of these. Their magic is bargained—whispered into their minds in moments of desperation, channeled through pacts sealed in shadow, blood, or dream. A warlock’s power is not their own. It is granted, leased, or perhaps loaned… and always with a price.

VALERUNE AND THE PACTBORN
Nowhere are warlocks more common than in the Land of Valerune, a cragged and mist-wrapped kingdom resting on the edge of the Great Chasm—a seemingly bottomless rift that splits the continent like an ancient wound. Legends claim the Chasm is a tear between worlds, a place where the veil between realities is thin and fraying. At night, strange lights flicker deep in its depths. Some say they are stars swallowed long ago. Others whisper of watching eyes.

The warlocks of Valerune are known as the Pactborn, and they are both feared and revered. Some commune with enigmatic fey voices that drift up from the Chasm’s deepest roots. Others strike deals with old gods cast down into shadow, aberrant minds that dwell beyond the stars, or even ghosts of forgotten titans entombed in the stone. In Valerune, it is said that the Chasm speaks—and those who listen too long never speak with their own voices again.

Most warlocks are marked in some way by their patron—a glimmer of gold beneath the skin, shadows that move when they stand still, or dreams they cannot forget. In court, they serve as spies and sorcerers. In the wilds, they are seekers, mad prophets, and cursed wanderers. The church names them heretics. The crown names them assets. But all agree: they are dangerous. Whether they walk freely or in secrecy, warlocks remain wild cards in the game of power. They serve no college, no god, and no master—at least, not any that most would dare name aloud.

LEVEL 3: Pact Boon (Su)

FEATURE: Pact Boon (Su)
Your patron grants you a tangible boon. Choose one:

Pact of the Blade.
You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You choose the weapon’s form each time you create it. The weapon counts as magical for overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. It disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more, if you dismiss it (no action), if you use this feature again, or if you die. You can bind a magic weapon as your pact weapon by performing a 1-hour ritual during a rest; you can’t affect an artifact or sentient weapon.

Pact of the Chain.
You learn Find Familiar and can cast it as a ritual. It doesn’t count against your spells known. When you cast it, you can choose a normal familiar or one of these special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite. Your familiar uses your initiative in the turn order.

Pact of the Tome.
Your patron gives you a Book of Shadows. Choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your cantrips known. If they aren’t on the warlock list, they are still warlock spells for you. If you lose the book, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement during a rest; the old book is destroyed.

Pact of the Talisman.
Your patron gives you an amulet. When the wearer fails an ability check, they can add 1d4 to the roll, potentially turning failure into success. This can be used a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), and all uses are restored when you finish a Rest. If you lose it, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony during a rest to receive a replacement; the old talisman is destroyed.
