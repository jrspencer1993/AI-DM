Marshal

“A single soldier can win a battle. A true leader wins wars.”
Where others charge ahead with steel and fury, the Marshal commands with presence, precision, and purpose. Marshals are battlefield tacticians, war leaders, and masters of morale—those rare few who can turn a scattered band of fighters into a coordinated force capable of breaking legions. A Marshal doesn’t lead from behind; they stand in the fray, reading the tide of battle and adjusting formations with a practiced eye. Their power lies not in brute strength or magical firepower, but in empowering others—directing, supporting, and unifying. They refuse chaos and impose order, winning not by overwhelming strength but by never giving the enemy a fair fight.

CLASS FEATURES
============================================================

LEVEL 1: Martial Die (Ex), Maneuvers Known, Fighting Style (Ex), Minor Auras (Ex)

FEATURE: Martial Die (Ex)
You gain a Martial Die that represents your physical precision and heroic edge in battle.
- Die starts as d6.
- Die increases at levels 6, 11, and 16 (to d8, d10, and d12 respectively).
- You can expend your Martial Die to:
  - Add to an attack roll, damage roll, ability check, or saving throw.
  - Fuel special Marshal maneuvers.
  - Add to a Combat Maneuver contest (such as Grapple, Trip, Disarm).
- Recovery: You regain all expended Martial Dice after a Long Rest.

FEATURE: Maneuvers Known
You learn two Marshal maneuvers.
- Restriction: You cannot select single-target buff maneuvers like Surging Strike or Heroic Second Wind. Your maneuvers must benefit allies or manipulate the battlefield.
- You learn additional maneuvers as shown on the class table.
- When you gain a level in this class, you may swap one maneuver you know for another from the Marshal list.

Marshal Maneuver Examples (reference list)
- Covering Advance: Expend 1 Martial Die. Allies within your aura may immediately move up to 10 feet. This movement does not provoke Attacks of Opportunity and ignores difficult terrain for that movement.
- Strike in Formation: When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, choose an ally within your aura who can see or hear you. That ally may immediately make a melee weapon attack against the same target as a reaction. If they hit, add the Martial Die roll to the damage.
- Banner of Defiance: Allies in your aura gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + Martial Die roll.
- Shield the Line: When a creature targets an ally within your aura with an attack, you may spend 1 Martial Die to impose a penalty on the attack roll equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum –1). This can be used after the roll but before the result is revealed.
- Break the Line: Expend 1 Martial Die. Choose a number of allies up to your Martial Die roll within your aura. Each may immediately move up to their speed in a straight line. If they end adjacent to an enemy, that enemy must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your Charisma modifier + 1/2 your level) or be knocked prone.
- Phalanx Reposition: When an enemy moves within 5 feet of an ally in your aura, you may expend 1 Martial Die to shift that ally 5 feet to a square adjacent to you or another ally within 5 feet. This movement does not provoke Attacks of Opportunity.
- Covering Advance (Reaction Variant): When an ally within your aura moves, you can expend 1 Martial Die as a reaction. The ally gains bonus AC equal to the die result until the start of their next turn or until they stop moving.
- Suppressive Volley: You issue suppressive orders that force the target to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your Charisma modifier + your Martial Die) or be unable to take Reactions until the start of your next turn.

Example Tactical Masteries (reference list)
- Coordinated Assault: When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, the next time an ally within your aura hits that creature before the start of your next turn, they deal extra damage equal to your Charisma modifier.
- Lead by Example: When you hit with a melee weapon attack, one ally within your aura may add +2 to their next attack roll or ability check made before the start of your next turn.
- Drill Sergeant: Once per turn, when an ally within your aura fails an attack roll or saving throw, they may reroll it and take the new result. This ability can be used once per Short Rest per ally.
- Hold the Line: When an ally within your aura would be forced to move against their will, you can use your reaction to allow them to make a Strength saving throw (DC equal to the original effect's DC, or 10 + enemy Strength modifier if none). On a success, they are not moved and are braced until the start of their next turn; while braced, they cannot be knocked prone.
- Opportune Orders: When initiative is rolled, choose up to three allies within your aura. Each gains +1 initiative, and may choose to delay to act immediately after you (once per combat).
