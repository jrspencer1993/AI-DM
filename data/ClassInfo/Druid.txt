Druid

“We do not rule nature. We remember how to listen to it.”
Druids are stewards of the wild and the memory of the world’s oldest pacts. Their power comes from the living essence of nature—roots, wind, stone, and predator. They move between beast and mortal form to preserve balance, whether as serene wardens or punishing storms.

Place of Importance: The Grove of Thalrien
Hidden within the Verdaneth Wilds lies the Grove of Thalrien, a living nexus where the Weave of life knots tightly. Protected by primal spirits and the Druids of the Circle Prime, the grove is a pilgrimage site of initiation and remembrance.
