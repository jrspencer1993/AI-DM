Paladin

Paladins are not born—they are forged. Their oath is not a formality; it is a flame, burning ever within their soul. Whether called by radiant visions, ancient codes, or whispered truths in the dark, a paladin swears an oath that binds them beyond death, doubt, and despair. They do not serve gods as much as ideals, and sometimes those ideals demand more than any mortal should bear. In gleaming armor or bloodstained plate, they march forward—not to inspire, but to endure. A paladin’s power does not come gently. It is a crucible. Every spell a promise, every strike a judgment. They can lay hands upon the wounded and draw breath back into broken lungs—then, in the next heartbeat, smite a creature into ash. Their presence can calm a crowd or silence a battlefield, a beacon of absolute certainty in a world that begs for compromise. Yet all paladins are bound by the same truth: when the dead rise, when the innocent cry out, when the abyss stares back—you will call them, and they will not turn away.

FEATURE: Spellcasting (Sp)
You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation.
Spell Slots. The Paladin Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells you can cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells.
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin Features table.
