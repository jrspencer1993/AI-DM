Ranger

Rangers are silent wardens of the wilderness—hunters, trackers, and protectors who walk the line between civilization and the untamed wilds. They are deeply attuned to the rhythms of nature, blending martial skill with primal instinct to defend the natural world from those who would defile or exploit it. Often solitary, rangers feel most at home beneath open skies or deep within ancient forests, deserts, and mountains. They travel light, move with purpose, and survive where others would perish. Some serve as guides or scouts, leading others through treacherous terrain, while others act as lone sentinels guarding sacred sites or endangered creatures. The ranger’s path is one of balance—between man and nature, tradition and necessity. While some study ancient groves or commune with nature spirits, others channel primal magic through the land itself. Their bond with the wilderness is both physical and mystical: they read signs with uncanny precision, track prey with unmatched skill, and may call upon nature’s power to heal, summon, or strike. Though often viewed as outsiders, rangers are indispensable in times of crisis—scouting ahead, neutralizing threats, and leading others through the unknown.

CLASS FEATURES
============================================================

LEVEL 1: Spellcasting (Ex), Favored Enemy (Ex), Natural Explorer (Ex)

FEATURE: Spellcasting (Ex)
You have learned to channel the magical essence of nature to cast spells.
Spell Slots. The Ranger Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.
Prepared Spells of Level 1+. You prepare the list of level 1+ spells available for you to cast. To start, choose two level 1 Ranger spells.
The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Ranger spell table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Ranger spells until the number matches the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Changing Your Prepared Spells. Whenever you finish a Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Ranger spell for which you have spell slots.
Spellcasting Ability
Your spellcasting ability is Wisdom. You use your Wisdom modifier when setting the DC for your Ranger spells and when making an attack roll with one.
- Spellcasting Ability: Wisdom
- Spell Save DC = 8 + spell level + your Wisdom modifier
- Spell Attack Modifier = base attack bonus + spell level + your Wisdom modifier

FEATURE: Extra Attack (Ex)
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
